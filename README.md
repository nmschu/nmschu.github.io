CIS 411 homework 3
=========================
The folders css, fonts, and js, along with the file config.json were brought in with bootstrap from getbootstrap.com 

I placed a file named jquery.validate.js to validate messages.html

=========================
Index.html acts as the main page of the website.

messages.html pops up when you click on “contact me” in the navigation bar, then select “message me”

page1.html is the page that opens when you click the “read more” button on the main page with “Something1”
